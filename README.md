# Auto_Bot
This repository provides code for three different projects i made using kinda similar apparatus
with swapping some components here and there, so here it is:
(i) Black Line follower
(ii) Ultrasonic ( here the bot detects obstacles and moves accordingly)
(iii) Remote control ( here I used Bluetooth module and the code is for the same)
The link for app to control bot is provided.
